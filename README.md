This is a solution to a HW2 for Machine Learning course at KSE.

Goal of this assignment is find the best forecasting model of work.ua CVs, open positions and wages using alternative data sources (Google Trends, Twitter Volumes and Nightlights in data_combined_monthly.csv). 

The assignment is done in R and includes:
- data cleaning and feature engineering;
- basic exploratory data analysis;
- model estimation (Random Forest, Lasso, Ridge, Generalized Additive Model using Splines);
- optimal model selection via cross-validation and grid search;
- prediction analysis;
- model refinement.
